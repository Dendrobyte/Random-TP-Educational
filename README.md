# RandomTP Educational Spigot/Bukkit Plugin

Hello! Welcome to a quick educational plugin. It's educational because it's relatively simple and is commented _heavily._

This is just covering some basic flow of using a command and how that command accesses things like the Player object, etc.

If there are any comments missing or things that are unclear, let me know on Twitter @Mobkinz78 or on Discord- link on [my website](http://www.markobacon.com/).

## This does NOT cover...

- How to use Java! You should be familiar with basic programming syntax. You won't find anything fancy here, but I'm not going to comment on explanatory if statements.
- Event handling. I haven't bothered.
- Why you need the plugin.yml exactly as it is. Those fields are necessary
- Building the plugin. I will not explain [what Maven is](https://maven.apache.org/) or how you can build the plugin. Mostly because it varies depending on how you use it.
- Code editor. Use whatever you want, any editor should be able to build a Maven project. Eclipse, VSCode, IntelliJ... whatever. "How to build a maven project <editor name>" is all you should need to google search- or ChatGPT it :)

## Intention

There are some blanks in this plugin! For example, it will teleport you to blocks 0,0 every time in its current state. You should modify these values and such to have fun with it. Change the command name. **Break things!** See what goes wrong, try to fix it. Hopefully you can find an article on how to build the plugin, like [the great beginner tutorial(s) on Spigot here.](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/)

You are free to do whatever you'd like with this plugin, limited as it is.
